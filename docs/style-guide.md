# Coding Style Guide

We use the [Swit.org API Design Guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/) as a base.

## SwiftLint

We use [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) to enforce our rules. It's integrated in the build process so you should see any violations in Xcode.
