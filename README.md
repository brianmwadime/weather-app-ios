## Build Instructions

1. Download Xcode

   At the moment _Weather for iOS_ uses Swift 5 and requires Xcode 13 or newer.

2. Install Ruby. We recommend using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) to install it. Please refer to the [`.ruby-version` file](.ruby-version) for the required Ruby version.

   We use Ruby to manage the third party dependencies and other tools and automation.

3. Clone project in the folder of your preference

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/brianmwadime/weather-app-ios.git
   ```

4. Enter the project directory

   ```bash
   cd weather-app-ios
   ```

5. Install the third party dependencies and tools required to run the project.

   ```bash
   bundle install && bundle exec rake dependencies
   ```

   This command installs the required tools.

6. Open the project by double clicking on `Weather.xcodeproj` file, or launching Xcode and choose File > Open and browse to `Weather.xcodeproj`
